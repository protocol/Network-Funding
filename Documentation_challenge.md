# Documentation challenge

This challenge will run from Feb 21 - May 21, 2022

## About

Protocol Labs’ documentation challenge is a “public goods” community competition to incentivize high quality and reach of documentation for teams that build on the IPFS / Filecoin stack.  We see documentation (user docs, tutorials, explainer blogs) as a critical path to attract and onboard users to the ecosystem - unfortunately, quality documentation can be under-appreciated and under-rewarded if not directly tied to revenue / funding / user growth.

The documentation challenge aims to accomplish the following goals:
- Reward teams with high quality documentation and incentivize improvements
- Reward effective distribution of documentation to new users
- Generate new cross-team collaborations on high-value documentation
- Increasing the number of community members participating in the creation, refinement, and distribution of documentation

Apply at this link and you will be contacted by the PL team

## Rules

Eligible teams are any for-profit / not-for profit organization building directly on the IPFS / Filecoin stack.

To participate and receive prizes, team who are selected must:
- Meet with / submit a short video update once a month to check in on progress / discuss feedback (week of March 14, April 14, May 7th)
- Achieve the minimum required threshold on the Documentation Checklist and demonstrate progress on documentation (details below)
- Act in the spirit of “public goods” (e.g. don't falsifying support / user feedback) - PL will disqualify teams acting poorly
- Submit additional supporting metrics / materials if needed at the end of the challenge for final evaluation

For this pilot we will select up to 25 teams.
